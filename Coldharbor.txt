In a remote cabin tucked between forested hills, Alan kept a low-powered ham radio set. He had built it himself years ago, soldering each connection with care. The antenna ran high above the treetops, catching signals from places he could only imagine.

Most nights were quiet. Sometimes he would scan the bands and catch short bursts of code from distant stations. Other times there was only static.

One night in late autumn, the wind picked up and the temperature dropped. A storm was moving in fast. As the power flickered and finally failed, Alan reached for his backup battery and switched on the rig.

He tapped out a call.

CQ CQ DE K3ALN K3ALN

A few minutes passed. Then a signal returned.

DE JA1XU UR RST 579

Alan grinned. Japan. Thousands of miles away. He kept the exchange short, basic signal reports and station info. No need for long messages. Just proof that the connection was there.

As the wind howled outside and the darkness deepened, he felt a strange comfort. While the world rushed forward with faster and newer ways to connect, this old method still worked. Reliable. Resilient.

The Morse key sat under his hand, warm from use. It spoke without voice, traveled without wires, and reached beyond mountains and oceans.

Out there, someone heard him. And he heard them.

In the quiet, that was enough.
