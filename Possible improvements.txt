Possible improvements you can make:

  ü§î  0. After you make a copy of this Playground (Duplicate), use SwiftUI       to improve the looks of the screen. For example, add more Padding       to the top of the Play button. The colors are jarring--change           them.
         Here's how: 
         https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui
     
 If the stories become boring or you start to memorize them, generate new stories with an AI app like ChatGPT. Use this prompt:

"Compose an original 200 to 300-word story in UTF-8 ASCII text format on the topic of Morse Code or Amateur Radio. The story should be a plain text file without special characters or formatting. Do not include quotation marks, colons and semicolons in the story. Use amateur radio Q codes when appropriate"

Then replace the text in one of the three story files in the Resouces Section with the AI generated story. The new story will be played 1/3 of the time when you start the Playground.
